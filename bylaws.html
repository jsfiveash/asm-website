        <p>The committee will review all nominations which it receives in a given
          year, and all such nominations will remain confidential to committee
          members. From nominations received in a given year, the Committee may
          select a winner or winners of the Award.</p>
        <p>If nominations received by the Committee for a given year are not
          worthy to receive the Award at that particular time, then there will
          be no Award given for that year. If the Committee selects a nominee
          or nominees to be given the Award, then the Committee must present
          their selection in a sealed envelope to the President of this Society
          at the September quarterly meeting. Only the Committee and the President
          shall know the name of the award winner prior to the announcement at
          the Annual Meeting.</p>
        <p>At the Annual Meeting, the President of this Society shall open the
          sealed envelope and shall announce to this Society's membership the
          winner of the Award. The President shall present to the winner a plaque
          recognizing the winner's achievement of the William B. Marye Award.
          The announcement shall then be printed in the next issue of this Society's
          newsletter.</p>
        <p> The plaque shall consist of a 9 X 12 inch wood base with a goldtone
          metal etching surface topped with a black metal etching surface upon
          which the following inscription is to appear:</p>
