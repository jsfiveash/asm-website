		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">Of Virginia's public lands, over 85% are submerged. From the coastal zone off the Eastern Shore to the wild
			mountain rivers, Virginia's sunken and submerged history includes every chapter of human occupation going back
			nearly 20,000 years. The Virginia Department of Historical Resources (DHR) is tasked with helping protect and
			learn from these resources, including archaeological resources along our shores and beneath the waves. This
			presentation describes how the Underwater Archaeology Program at DHR functions to pursue its goals of
			preservation and education.</p>

		    <p style="color:black">presented by: <strong>Dr. Julie Markin</strong></p>
			    
		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">At the Barwick’s Ordinary site, an exciting collaboration of volunteer, student, and professional archaeologists is
			shedding light on the Eastern Shore’s early colonial history. By the late 18th century, a small complex of buildings
			on the Choptank River near Denton became the first county seat of the newly formed Caroline County. One of the
			buildings belonged to tavern/ordinary owner James Barwick. Remote sensing conducted by MHT archaeologists
			identified possible historic structures. Excavations by the Washington College archaeology field school last summer
			uncovered what might be the cellar to Barwick’s tavern and its privy. Early 18th century pottery and coins - and a
			single glass trade bead - indicate the site was active prior to Barwick’s residency, but this is based mainly on
			plowzone contexts. The 2022 field session will dig into these structures to determine when they were active and
			what types of activities were taking place, helping us to determine if we have found Barwick’s tavern and the
			location of Caroline County’s first county seat or the remains of an earlier household or commercial establishment.</p>
			    
		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">Dr. Julie Markin is an Associate Professor of Anthropology at Washington College. She earned her bachelor’s
			degree in Anthropology and History from the University of Alabama and her doctoral degree in Ecological Anthropology from the University of 
			Georgia. Dr. Markin examines political and economic inequality in the Pre-Columbian United States with a focus on how environmental abundance, 
			settlement location and subsistence production intersect to fuel [or preclude] the rise of socially and politically complex societies.</p>

		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">he Conowingo site (18CE14) has been described as a Late Archaic-Late Woodland seasonal base camp
			supported by a series of exploitive procurement camps supplying non-local goods. This description of one of the
			largest pre-contact sites in Maryland has been de rigueur since the site was excavated by the Archaeological
			Society of Maryland in 1981-1982. Multiple severe flooding episodes have ensured that later excavations have not
			supplied much data to alter this narrative. However, the currently accepted time of occupation and interpretation of
			site function do not include data from over 100 years of avocational archaeologists collecting artifacts from the site.
			Analysis of the Stearns collection from the 1930s indicates the presence of a significant Middle Archaic
			component, and a much heavier reliance on local goods than initially inferred."</p>

		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">Records written by English colonizers in the 17th century paint a picture of amicable relations between them and

			advantage of over two decades of knowledge of the successes and failures of the Virginia Company in their
			relations with the Native people of the Chesapeake. Reading between the lines and being critical of the source of
			the documentary record, however, reveals a much more complex story about Anglo-Native interactions. The ways
			in which the English advanced settlement in the region and the reactions of Native people will be discussed, with
			some archaeological tidbits along the way.</p>

		   <p style="color:black">presented by: <strong>Dr. Michael Lucas</strong></p>  
			    
		   <p  align="left" style="color:black">Research by archaeologists has demonstrated the temporal occurrence of European clay tobacco pipes from the

			dates is well understood. Criteria such as use-wear and modification have been largely ignored, yet these
			measures illustrate distinct differences among assemblages from European and Indigenous sites. A closer look at

			a variety of seventeenth century sites.</p>
