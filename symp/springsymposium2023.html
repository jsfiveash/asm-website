			    planned as a means to expose students to archeological research. After GPR and excavation confirmed the existence of many burials,

		   <p  align="left" style="color:black">Through educational programs and outreach, archeologists are inspiring new generations to explore the many 
			   fields of archeological study. Archeology can be redress; it can begin the process of setting right the wrongs cause by those in the past. 
			   It can do social justice work, particularly with communities that have been victim to past atrocities. Archeologists can raise collective
			   consciousness and promote the demands and desires of the communities where they work. <i>Archaeology in the Community (AITC) uses archaeology 
			   education as a tool of redress; it conducts programs in communities seeking to address local needs and heritage concerns identified by the
			   local communities.</i></p>

		    <p style="color:black">presented by: <strong>Julia King</strong></p>
			    
		    <p  align="left" style="color:black">In the 21st-Century Middle Atlantic landscape, traces of earlier times and places survive, easily observed 
			    if we take the time to notice them. For the region's Indigenous communities, finding these traces requires oral history, archeology, 
			    documents, environmental data and occasionally even astronomical evidence. This presentation describes how these varied sets of information
			    were woven together to reveal the Indigenous landscape and people of the 16th- and 17th-Century Rappahannock River valley in Virginia 
			    and how they can be used to do the same in Maryland.</p>

		   <p style="color:black">presented by: <strong>Dennis Curry</strong></p>  
			    
		   <p  align="left" style="color:black">Canavest (also known as the Heater’s Island site) was the last permanent village of the Piscataway (Conoy) 
			   Indians in Maryland. Various aspects of the site—occupied from 1699 to at least 1712—are vividly described in a series of colonial 
			   documents from Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. These archival records are paired with analysis of archeological remains to provide 
			   a glimpse of late 17th Century Piscataway life. Despite their presumed removal, Piscataways still reside in the state, largely in 
			   Southern Maryland, where they are experiencing a modern-day resurgence.</p>
